## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow (even though I really think I'll do the opposite in the future)
- SCSS/SASS

### What I learned

Just learned about SASS/SCSS two days ago.. Even if I think it was a bit overkill for that kind of project I kinda like the way you can organize the code.

### Continued development

I will focus on building a better SCSS structure. I couldn't figure out how to apply the border radius on both mobile and desktop.
